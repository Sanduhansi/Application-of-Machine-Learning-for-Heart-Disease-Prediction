 Heart disease is one of the leading causes of death worldwide, making early detection crucial for saving lives. This study explores how machine learning can help predict heart disease using patient medical data. We tested three different computer algorithms: Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Neural Network on a dataset of 303 patients with 14 medical features. The data was processed and cleaned before training the models. We measured how well each algorithm performed using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The Neural Network performed best with 75.82% accuracy, while Logistic Regression achieved 76.92% and SVM reached 76.92%. An ensemble model combining all three algorithms achieved the highest performance with 79.12% accuracy. These results show that machine learning can be a valuable tool for doctors to identify patients at risk of heart disease, potentially leading to earlier treatment and better outcomes.
